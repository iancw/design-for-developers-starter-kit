# [ProjectName] Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
*What problems are you trying to solve? What is the purpose of the app? (2-3 sentences)*

I like to read the passages for upcoming sermons the week before it's delivered.  Tracking
which sermon passage is next requires checking the church website weekly (and following a few links)
or keeping track of a sermon card.  The website will display the upcoming sermon passage and
provide a link to sign up for email updates.


## The key users.
*Describe behaviors, expectation, knowledge, or other characteristics. (One sentence each)*

The primary user is a person who regularly attends the church and is interested in preparing
for upcoming sermons by pre-reading the passage.  This person has likely heard about the
website through word of mouth, and is primarily visiting the site to subscribe to receive
emails.


## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
*These should be short narratives of the above users with your app / site. (One sentence each)*

Christian is interested in regularly reading passages for upcoming sermons every morning, but
finds himself losing track of which sermon passage is next.  He visits the web site,
sees the upcoming passage, and clicks the link to subscribe to regular emails containing the passage.

Christine has already subscribed to the regular emails, and is tired of the inbox clutter.  She would
like to un-subscribe from the emails.  There will be a link in the email to unsubscribe, which takes
her to a web page that says something nice and takes her off the distribution list.

## Design style guidelines to follow.
*These are a list of qualities or characteristics (usually adjectives) you'd like the design to follow. The more specific you are with these the easier it will be for you to create a compelling design (e.g. don't use "Clean"). (2-3 words)*

 * Literary
 * Timeless
 * Focused
